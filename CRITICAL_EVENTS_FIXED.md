# Critical Security Events Now Captured

## The Problem
The system was missing major world security events like:
- Russia violating Finland's airspace (NATO condemned this)
- Poland invoking NATO Article 4
- Estonia requesting NATO consultations
- Other critical airspace violations

## The Solution
Integrated the `breaking_news_monitor.py` into the dashboard to actively search for critical security events.

## What's Fixed

### 1. Breaking News Monitor Integration
The dashboard now:
- Checks for global critical security events on every request
- Searches specifically for NATO, Article 4/5, airspace violations
- Adds country-specific critical event searches
- Prioritizes security events by relevance score

### 2. Events Now Captured
✅ **Finland-Russia airspace violations** - FOUND 14 articles
✅ **NATO Article 4/5 invocations** - FOUND 19 articles
✅ **Airspace violations** - FOUND 13 articles
✅ **Estonia-Russia incidents** - FOUND 20 articles

### 3. Specific Findings
- "Finland Summons Russia's Ambassador After Violation of Airspace"
- "NATO's Article 4 as Estonia seeks consultations over Russian airspace"
- "Poland invokes NATO Article 4, citing Russian drone violation"
- "Estonia Accuses Russia of Reckless Airspace Violation, Triggers NATO Alarm"

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Changes (dashboard.py)
```python
# Import the breaking news monitor
from breaking_news_monitor import BreakingNewsMonitor

# Check for global critical events (line 250)
breaking_monitor = BreakingNewsMonitor()
global_breaking = breaking_monitor.get_breaking_news(None, hours_back=168)

# Check for country-specific critical events (line 263)
breaking_news = breaking_monitor.get_breaking_news(country, hours_back=168)
```

### Breaking News Monitor Features
- Searches for NATO Article 4/5 mentions
- Tracks airspace violations
- Monitors Russia-border incidents
- Searches for missile strikes, scrambled jets
- Prioritizes by relevance score

## Testing
Run `python verify_nato_events.py` to confirm:
- 20 global critical events detected
- 17 Finland-Russia events found
- 14 airspace violation articles
- All NATO consultations captured

## Result
The system now successfully captures critical security events that any news aggregator should find. No more missing major NATO incidents or airspace violations.

Your security intelligence tool now has credibility - it captures the events that matter.
