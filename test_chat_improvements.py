institutional weaknesses that have been exacerbated by recent events. The gang
violence that has plagued the country is not merely a law enforcement issue but

**Haiti Security Analysis**

Gang violence has escalated dramatically, with armed groups now controlling
60% of Port-au-Prince and major transport routes.

Key Facts:

• Main port and airport frequently blocked

The situation stems from state collapse following the 2021 presidential
assassination, with gangs filling the power vacuum.

Monitor: Kenya police deployment, humanitarian access, gang alliances.
