# Intelligence Analyst Chat Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CIA Factbook Data Integration ✅
**Problem**: Chat couldn't access CIA Factbook or country data
**Solution**: Added `CountryIntelligence` integration that provides:
- Population, capital, area, government type
- Languages, UN membership status
- CIA Factbook reference URL
- Triggered by keywords: "gdp", "economy", "population", "capital", "government", "cia", "factbook"

### 2. Formatting Issues ✅
**Problem**: Responses had ugly markdown formatting (asterisks, bold text)
**Solution**: Updated prompts to enforce plain text:
- No markdown (no **, no *, no ###)
- Use dashes (-) for bullet points, not asterisks
- Plain text only
- Clean, readable format

### 3. Verbosity ✅
**Problem**: Responses were too long (500+ words)
**Solution**: Enforced strict limits:
- Maximum 100 words (down from 150)
- 2-3 sentences only
- Brief bullet points
- Removed unnecessary sections

## Example Responses

### BEFORE (Bad):
```
**Haiti** has a ***complex*** economic situation characterized by:

### Economic Indicators:
* **GDP**: The Gross Domestic Product...
* **Population**: Approximately ***11.4 million***...

The situation is further complicated by multiple factors including but not limited to historical debt burdens, political instability, natural disasters...
[continues for 500+ words]
```

### AFTER (Good):
```
Haiti has a population of 11,402,533 and faces severe economic challenges. The economy relies heavily on remittances and agriculture.

Key facts:
- Capital: Port-au-Prince
- Area: 27,750 km²
- Government: Republic

CIA Factbook: https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/haiti/
```

## How It Works

When you ask about factual data (GDP, population, etc.), the system:

1. **Detects keywords** in your question
2. **Fetches data** from REST Countries API
3. **Adds to context** before sending to AI
4. **AI responds** with specific facts

## Available Data

The chat can now provide:
- **Basic Facts**: Capital, population, area, government type
- **Geographic**: Landlocked status, borders, coordinates
- **Political**: Government type, UN membership
- **Economic**: GDP references, currency info
- **References**: CIA Factbook URL, Wikipedia link

## Usage Examples

### Question Types That Work Well:
- "What is Haiti's population and capital?"
- "Tell me about Ukraine's government type"
- "What does the CIA factbook say about Somalia?"
- "What is Taiwan's area and is it in the UN?"

### Clean Responses:
- Short, factual answers
- Specific numbers when available
- Source citations
- No markdown clutter

## Testing

Run the test:
```bash
python test_chat_improvements_v2.py
```

This verifies:
- CIA data is included
- Formatting is clean
- Responses are concise
- Facts are accurate
