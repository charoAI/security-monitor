# Date Information Fix for Intelligence Analyst

## Problem
The chat knew about events but couldn't tell you WHEN they happened:

**User**: "Tell me about the hotel attack"
**AI**: "Al-Shabaab attacked the Qahira Hotel in Mogadishu..."

**User**: "When did it happen?"
**AI**: "The provided text doesn't give a specific date..."

## Solution
Added publication dates to the article context sent to the AI.

### Changes Made:

1. **Token Optimizer** - Now preserves `published` date field
2. **LLM Synthesizer** - Includes dates in article summaries
3. **Format** - Articles now show as: "Title (Date)"

### Before:
```
CRITICAL:
• Al-Shabaab attacks Qahira Hotel in Mogadishu
• Severe drought causes catastrophic famine
```

### After:
```
CRITICAL:
• Al-Shabaab attacks Qahira Hotel in Mogadishu (Dec 23)
• Severe drought causes catastrophic famine (Dec 22)
```

## How It Works

When preparing articles for the AI:
1. Extract publication date from RSS feed
2. Format date (removes time, keeps just date)
3. Append to article title in parentheses
4. AI can now reference specific dates

## Example Responses

**Question**: "When did the hotel attack happen?"
**New Response**: "The Qahira Hotel attack occurred on December 23, based on the report date."

**Question**: "What are the most recent events?"
**New Response**: "The most recent events include the hotel attack (Dec 23) and famine reports (Dec 22)."

## Benefits

✅ AI can now answer "when" questions
✅ Better temporal context for events
✅ Can identify most recent vs older news
✅ More accurate intelligence reporting

## Testing

Try asking:
- "When did [specific event] happen?"
- "What happened in the last 3 days?"
- "What's the timeline of recent events?"

The Intelligence Analyst now has temporal awareness!
